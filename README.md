# Real-Time-Data-Streaming-Pipeline

Conceptualized, designed, and implemented a cutting-edge real-time data streaming pipeline that captures, processes, and delivers live events from multiple sources with minimal latency. This solution ensures that critical business data is immediately available for analytics, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in real time.

Detailed Description:

What you did: Developed Kafka producers to simulate high-frequency event streams, such as e-commerce order transactions, inventory updates, and customer interactions. Built Kafka consumers to process, validate, and route these events into Snowflake on Azure, maintaining high reliability and fault tolerance.

How you did it: Leveraged Python with Kafka Producer/Consumer APIs for robust event streaming, integrated Snowflake Python connector for seamless ingestion, and applied threading to handle multiple parallel event streams. Implemented logging and error handling to monitor and maintain data integrity across the pipeline.

Use/Impact: This pipeline enables real-time dashboards, instant inventory monitoring, and live sales analytics. It reduces decision-making lag, enhances operational efficiency, and provides a foundation for predictive analytics and dynamic business responses.
